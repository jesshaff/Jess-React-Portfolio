    "aboutme":"Hello! My name is Jessica Haff. I am 27 years old and live in Gainesville, GA. I am currently a Project Manager at Loeb Electric. I found my passion for web development when I started looking into building my own website for my online boutique. I decided that a coding bootcamp would be the best way to learn. Despite my background in customer service and my associates degree in business I have always had a passion for technology and learning new skills to advance my technical knowledge. I am currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech so that I can become a web developer. Currently, I have learned and practiced HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Github. I am expected to complete my coding bootcamp April 16, 2022.",
